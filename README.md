# SQL Overview

**IMPORTANT:** The Database for these activities is compressed using ZIP! There's a notebook `Unzip Database File` that takes care of that.


This class focuses on different queries that can be done with SQL. We'll see simple SELECT statements, some more advanced ones using JOINs and also Aggregation.
We'll finish the lesson with an overview of INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.

### The Database

We'll use a public Database from Kaggle that you can find here: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer

The data model is also available in Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/data](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/data). You can browse each table's structure from within that view.
